# grails-react-oauth-google

This application is based off of the guide 
http://guides.grails.org/react-spring-security/guide/index.html. It is
basically an extended example where the ability to authenticate using Google OAuth2 has been added. There are 
additional stub blocks for Facebook and Twitter. To get Google auth working just add your client key and secret to
the appropriate location in the application.groovy file and it should work. Facebook should work similarly, add your
client key and secret to application.groovy. Facebook may have an issue, in a quick trial run could not get all the
way through the login process.
